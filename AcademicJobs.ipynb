      " Contract type: Full time (35 hours per week) Fixed Term available from 1st September 2025 until 31st August 2028 Location: Usher Institute, Usher Building, 5-7 Little France Road, Edinburgh BioQuarter - Gate 3, Edinburgh, EH16 4UX   This post is advertised as full-time (35 hours per week), however, we will consider part-time or flexible working patterns (minimum of 20 hours/ week).  We will also consider requests for hybrid working (on a non-contractual basis) that combines a mix of remote and regular (weekly) on-campus working. The Usher Institute expects a minimum of 40% on campus working.  The Centre for Medical Informatics at the Usher Institute within The University of Edinburgh is looking for a Data Analyst.  The Opportunity:  This post offers the opportunity to work on an exciting new initiative using data driven research approaches to improve child health through housing interventions as part of a new 5 year Wellcome funded study, Homes, Heat and Healthy Kids.  This study capitalises on the new ability to link healthcare and individual property-level data across Scotland for the first time, to create a rich retrospective birth cohort linking electronic health records with data on home energy efficiency and energy use, smart meters, high street banking, air pollution and climate.  You will work in a fast-paced, agile and cross-sectoral research environment. Public and political consciousness of the link between health and housing is rising. The study already has over 50 organisations as stakeholders, including policy makers, public sector, third sector and industry partners. You will be collaborating with our stakeholders to develop novel methodology to:  Provide policy makers with estimates of how many preschool respiratory infections could be avoided if every home was adequately heated. Explore how different ways of making homes warmer affect the risk of respiratory infection risk, in particular the balance between warmth and reduced indoor air quality. This body of work has the potential to influence housing, health, energy and Net Zero policies. There will be significant opportunities to develop both public engagement and policy translation skills for the successful applicant.  Informal enquiries may be directed to Dr Olivia Swann, Senior Clinical Research Fellow and Honorary Consultant in Paediatric Infectious Disease (Olivia.Swann@ed.ac.uk).

      " The University of Surrey is a global community of ideas and people, dedicated to life-changing education and research.   We are ambitious and have a bold vision of what we want to achieve - shaping ourselves into one of the best universities in the world, which we are achieving through the talents and endeavour of every employee.    Our culture empowers people to achieve this aim and to collectively, and individually, make a real difference.    The role  We are seeking qualified applicants for a position as Language Data Scientist on the ERC Synergy grant ‚ÄòNILOMORPH: The evolution of suprasegmental morphology in West Nilotic‚Äô, led by Matthew Baerman. The successful candidate will perform a key role in managing, processing and analyzing language data generated across the multiple teams that make up the project. The position is based at the Surrey Morphology Group at the University of Surrey, in Guildford, UK, and provides the opportunity to work in the vibrant and highly collegial research environment for which the SMG is renowned.  Background  The NILOMORPH project aims to reconstruct the morphological evolution of the West Nilotic languages, spoken primarily in South Sudan and neighboring countries. These languages have developed some of the most remarkable morphological systems on the planet, where simultaneous manipulation of multiple phonological features (vowel length, vowel height, tone, phonation type) results in enormous paradigms marked solely by the modulation of vowel properties.   The NILOMORPH combines fieldwork, experimental methods, and historical linguistics to account for the phonological, morphological and psycholinguistic pathways that led to this unique outcome. The project is spread across multiple teams, based in the UK, France, Germany and the USA, and will make use of a diverse range of language data taken from multiple sources: ongoing fieldwork, previous studies, text corpora and newly-generated reconstructions, as well as well as the results of computational simulations and artificial language learning experiments.  Responsiblities  The successful candidate will develop and execute a set of data management and analysis tools will enable the diverse international team of researchers to create, access and manipulate the language data that is central to the NILOMORPH project.   As a core member of the Surrey-based team, the successful candidate will provide expert guidance on methods and tools for data analysis, including data design, data management protocols and statistical analysis. They will collaborate closely in the writing and dissemination of papers and presentations, and be expected to take initiative in the formulation of the research agenda.   They will also participate in the broader activities both of the NILOMORPH group and of the Surrey Morphology Group (SMG). The candidate will have opportunities at SMG to develop their research leadership profile while interacting with world-class researchers.   About you  Suitable candidates with a background in linguistics (or linguistics-adjacent fields) are strongly encouraged to apply. Please refer to the full job description, under ‚ÄòAddendum‚Äô for essential and desirable criteria.   How to apply  The following documents will be required:  CV Contact details for 2 academic/industry referees. Three relevant works of research (DOI/URL links if possible). Research statement of one page, describing research interests and experience, and how you think this makes you suitable for the advertised post. A completed application form  Interviews are planned for 02 September 2025 and will be held online. Please contact Matthew Baerman m.baerman@surrey.ac.uk with any questions.\n",

      " Applications are invited for three (3) PhD Studentships, based at the Department of Statistical Science, UCL. The positions can involve any topic within the Statistical Science remit. The positions are open to both Home and Overseas applicants. Successful applicants are expected to start their PhD studies in October 2025, however we will also consider applications where the PhD studies can begin in February 2026 which is the second possible starting date for a PhD through the year according to UCL rules.  The Department is among the three largest Statistics groups in the UK with more than 30 academic members of staff. Research in the Department is organised into six themes: Causality; Computational Statistics and Machine Learning; Economics, Finance and Business; Environmental Statistics; Probability; Statistics in Biomedicine and Health Economics. Research often cuts across these areas. Much of the research is interdisciplinary and involves collaborations within and outside UCL.  Each of the Departmental Studentships will be 3.5 years in duration (or 6 years for part-time students) and will cover the full tuition fees, an annual maintenance stipend (this was ¬£22,237 for 2024/25, with some rise expected to be applied for 2025/26 and for each of the subsequent years during the PhD) and an allowance for research training.  Full-time students will spend 6 months of their time for teaching (spread across the 3.5 years) and devote the remainder of their time to undertaking their research.  Person Specification  The requirement for admission to the MPhil/PhD in Statistical Science is a 1st class or high upper 2nd class Bachelor‚Äôs degree, or a Master‚Äôs degree with merit or distinction, in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, or a related quantitative discipline.

      " Candidates will study for a four year, full time funded PhD (3 quarters of your time) whilst working and receiving a salary to gain valuable teaching experience (1 quarter of your time). Candidates will receive a salary and stipend package that exceeds the standard UKRI stipend for a full-time PhD.  Home/RoI Students will have their PhD fees waived, International students will receive a fee waiver equivalent to the Home/RoI fee and will be expected to fund the difference between the International fee and the Home/RoI fee. There will be a package of support to enable you to develop a research career in this exciting field.  The Royal Berkshire Hospital has 20 surgical theatres and only 3-4 beds for patients‚Äô overnight full recovery from anaesthesia. Thus to avoid exceeding the bed capacity a daily limit is imposed on those surgeries that are deemed likely to require overnight stay for post anaesthesia recovery. The needed post-operative care is predicted manually based on a pre-operative assessment for surgeries case selection to be scheduled for each day. This decision process is poorly recorded and needs improvement.  Aims and Objectives  In collaboration with the Health Innovation Partnership, a modelling pipeline will be devised to cope with the challenges of data augmentation and model optimisation to deliver a reliable prediction of patient needs into recovery services after surgery, improving the deployment of available resources, ensuring patient quality-of-care and reducing waiting lists.  This will be achieved through the following objectives:  Acquire data and expert-based evidence and optimise data augmentation to ensure optimal hospital patient pathways through pre-operative assessment, surgery, anaesthetic normal recovery, extended recovery, and ICU services: bookings, utilisation, pre-operative and on-the-day cancellations, emergencies, and, non-attendances. Establish a clinical scoring system to predict patients‚Äô post-operative anaesthetic recovery needs to three severity and associated care levels and respective predicted nurse-to-patient ratio required (complexity). Develop and optimise a modelling pipeline including a decision support dashboard for optimal patient selection for surgery to ensure daily surgery caseload optimisation, post-operative care manageability, patient safety, and reduce waiting lists.  You will need to demonstrate you:  Meet the academic requirements for a PhD offer from the University of Reading. Have a MSc degree in Computer Science or a related discipline Are able to effectively organise your time and prioritise tasks to balance PhD studies with GTA responsibilities Are able to demonstrate scholarship in developing a publication record in your area of specialist expertise and conduct high quality PhD research. Are able to communicate scientific concepts clearly and with enthusiasm and in a way that engages students Have good interpersonal skills and be able to work as part of a team See candidate pack at the bottom of the page for further details.  How do I apply?  You must upload a combined CV and Proposal in pdf format (max size 1 MB) and complete the supporting statement.  We look forward to hearing from you!
